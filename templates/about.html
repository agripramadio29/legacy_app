                    As a DevOps Engineer, I frequently found myself immersed in the repetitive task of configuring
                    servers, especially when it came to addressing specific errors that necessitated restarting
                    PostgreSQL servers and Apache Tomcat webservers. Despite having Ansible at my disposal, the
                    monotony persisted, especially for my Windows-using colleagues who had to resort to installing
                    third-party SSH clients for their tasks. This additional step only added to the inertia, making
                    the entire process cumbersome and time-consuming. It was during one particularly frustrating
                    commute, trapped in the notorious Cawang Traffic Jam, that the idea for this application dawned on
                    me. Frustrated by the manual slog of restarting services via SSH, I recognized the urgent need for
                    a more efficient solution. Thus, this project was born - an application meticulously crafted to
                    streamline the service restarting process, thereby eradicating the need for tedious manual
                    interventions. Its purpose? To simplify the lives of both my colleagues and myself, ushering in a
                    new era of productivity and efficiency in our server management endeavors.

                    Currently, Legacy is only available for Linux Servers. Maybe in the future,
                    I will build one for Windows Servers. Maybe if I'm not preoccupied with my
                    office tasks, and stuck in traffic jams.
